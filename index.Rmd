## Bio
 
I am currently a Master's student at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, where I am concentrating in Corporate Environmental Management. I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, but was inspired to pursue a career in the environmental field after becoming PADI certified and having the opportunity to SCUBA dive. SCUBA diving exposed me to a whole new part of the earth that I had never seen so clearly before, and I am now hoping to use my engineering and science education to solve environmental problems. In my free time, I love to hike, swim in the ocean, and explore Santa Barbara.
