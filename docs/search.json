I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering, but was inspired to pursue a career in the environmental field after becoming PADI certified and having the opportunity to SCUBA dive. SCUBA diving exposed me to a whole new part of the earth that I had never seen so clearly before, and I am now hoping to use my engineering and science education to solve environmental problems. In my free time, I love to hike, swim in the ocean, and explore all parts of Santa Barbara.\nEducation\nUCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management | Santa Barbara, CA\nMaster of Environmental Science and Management | September 2021 - June 2023\nCarnegie Mellon University | Pittsburgh, PA\nB.S. in Civil Engineering, Additional Major in Engineering and Public Policy | August 2017 - May 2021\nExperience\nFood Systems Policy Research Assistant | Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA | August 2020 - May 2021\n• Developed recommendations for food policy by analyzing the effectiveness and uncertainty of three proposed policies pertaining to the environmental sustainability and equity of the Pittsburgh food system\n• Authored an academic paper with policy recommendations to reduce food waste and meat consumption to lower carbon emissions by up to 50%\nCivil Engineering Research Assistant | Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA | May 2019 - December 2019\n• Developed a hand washing monitoring system through data analysis; collected vibration data from 4 sink locations and analyzed the data in MATLAB using feature selection and support vector machines\n• Co-authored an academic paper that will be published in ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare\nEngineering, Scientific, and Technical Intern | Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Pittsburgh, PA | May 2018 - August 2018\n• Utilized roadway design plans and construction standards to ensure accurate implementation and environmental compliance of various types of drainage adjustments and paving operations\n• Assisted construction inspectors with calculations for bridge and roadway construction projects to ensure PennDOT construction specification were met and to ensure engineering integrity\nEngineering Projects\nElectric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Impacts | Engineering and Public Policy Senior Projects II | February 2021 - May 2021\n• Analyzed the effects of increased EV adoption by using Excel to model what percent of EV adoption would threaten local electric grid reliability due to decreased prospective reserve margins\n• Formed recommendations for policy makers to support an equitable transition to electric vehicles\nAquaponics Greenhouse | Civil and Environmental Engineering Senior Design | August 2020 - December 2020\n• Designed and built a mock-up aquaponics system with a nine-person team for a Pittsburgh community\n• Consulted with stakeholders at the Center of Life and at Hatponics Sustainable Agriculture to ensure that the complex technical components of the system met the center’s educational and environmental goals\nPhotos\nDiving in Key West, Florida 2021Hiking in Antelope Canyon, Arizona 2016\n\n\n",
